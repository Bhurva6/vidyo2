## IntroductionðŸ’¡

This project, developed as part of the Frontend Internship Assignment, is a feature-rich Video Player crafted using ReactJS and HTML5 Canvas. Its primary focus was to enable users to interact with video files effectively while displaying metadata and enhancing user experience.
The application seamlessly accepts video files as input, displaying essential metadata such as duration prominently on the UI. Leveraging HTML5 Canvas, it ingeniously presents the video upon user selection. Notably, a user-friendly play/pause button at the center of the video container offers intuitive control over video playback.The UI is meticulously designed, ensuring a clean, intuitive layout for effortless navigation. The components are thoughtfully arranged, making it user-friendly and easy to comprehend. The inclusion of engaging elements, such as the play/pause, forward /rewind by 5 seconds button, and audio waveform visualization, enhances the overall user experience.

Play/Pause Control: A central play/pause button allows effortless control over video playback with a simple click.
### Audio Detection and Visualization
Audio Recognition: The system automatically detects if the uploaded video contains audio.
Audio Waveform Display: When audio is present, the application generates and displays a visual waveform representation, offering users a visual glimpse of the audio content.
### UI Design and Experience
User-Friendly Interface: The UI is designed to be intuitive, facilitating easy navigation and understanding.
Enhanced User Experience: Engaging components, such as the play/pause button and audio waveform visualization, enhance the overall user interaction.
### Implementation Details
ReactJS Structure: The project is structured using ReactJS, ensuring a well-organized and modular codebase.
Component-Based Design: Each feature and element is encapsulated within distinct components, promoting code reusability and maintainability.
### Repository and Live Deployment
GitHub Repository: The GitHub repository hosts the complete source code for review, exploration, and contributions.
Live Deployment: Access the application through Vercel (https://vidyoplayer-nine.vercel.app/), providing a live, functional demonstration of the Video Player.
Usage
Clone or Fork: Clone or fork the repository to explore the codebase or contribute enhancements.
